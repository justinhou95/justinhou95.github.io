> Let $$X,Y$$ Gaussian random variables. Is $$(X,Y)$$ Gaussian?

If you google it, there are many counter-examples proving why this is NOT true in general. However, I find much less discussion on whether this could be true under some condition. So I decide to share my thoughts from a optimal transport point of view. 

### A counter example
We start with a well-known counter-example:

Let $$X$$ be a standard Gaussian, $$W$$ be coin-flip i.e. a Bernoulli random variable
taking values 1 and âˆ’1 with equal probability. If we define $$Y = W X$$, then $$Y$$ is still standard Gaussian by symmetric argument. However $$X+Y$$ is not even Gaussian because $$X+Y = 0$$ holds with probability $$1/2$$.

Another observation is that $$\mathbb{E}[XY] = 0$$. So this is also an example when uncorrelated but dependent. Anyhow we have a counter example.

### A simple example

Let $$X,Y$$ standard Gaussian with correlation $$1$$ i.e. $$\mathbb{E}[XY] = 1$$. Then $$\mathbb{E}[(X-Y)^2] = 0$$, so $$X=Y$$. Therefore $$(X,Y)$$ is Gaussian!

It is not difficult to generalize this to multi-dimension. Let $$X,Y$$ be standard Gaussian on $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ and assume $$(X,Y)$$ has covariance matrix:
$$
\mathrm{Cov}\Big(\begin{bmatrix}X\\ Y\end{bmatrix}\Big) =  \begin{bmatrix}I&P\\ P^\top&I \end{bmatrix}.
$$
If $$P$$ is orthogonal i.e. $$PP^\top = I$$, then similarly we get 

$$
\mathbb{E}[(X-PY)^2] = \mathrm{tr}\Big(\begin{bmatrix}I & -P\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}I&P\\ P^\top&I \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}I \\ -P^\top\end{bmatrix}\Big) = 0.
$$

So $$Y = P^\top X$$ and $$(X,Y)$$ is Gaussian. 

Actually, $$\begin{bmatrix}I&P\\ P^\top&I \end{bmatrix}$$ is positive semidefinite if and only if $$P$$ is a contraction matrix. 

### Non-degenerate marginals

More generally, we consider $$X \sim \mathcal{N}(a,A)$$ and $$Y \sim \mathcal{N}(a,B)$$ where $$A,B$$ are positive semidefinite matrix. We represent the covariance matrix of $$(X,Y)$$ by 
$$
\mathrm{Cov}\Big(\begin{bmatrix}X\\ Y\end{bmatrix}\Big) =  \begin{bmatrix}A&C\\ C^\top&B \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Then by using the Cholesky decomposition $$A = LL^\top$$ and $$B= MM^\top$$, we transform $$(X,Y)$$ to $$(L^{-1}X, M^{-1}Y)$$ and simplify the problem to our simple example before:

$$
\mathrm{Cov}\Big(\begin{bmatrix}L^{-1}X\\ M^{-1}Y\end{bmatrix}\Big) =  \begin{bmatrix}I&L^{-1}C(M^{-1})^{\top}\\ M^{-1}C^\top (L^{-1})^{\top}&I \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Therefore, if $$C = LPM^{\top}$$ where $$P$$ is orthogonal, $$(X,Y)$$ is Gaussian.

### Optimal transport point of view

You might think how this related to optimal transport. If you have a hammer everything looks like a nail. It follows directly from the uniqueness of optimal coupling of non-degenerate quadratic cost.
