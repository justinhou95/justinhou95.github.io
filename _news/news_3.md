ðŸš€ Excited to share our latest work: PNOT: Python Nested Optimal Transport â€” developed together with Ruben Bontorno! PNOT offers ultra-fast C++ solvers with a Python interface for solving nested (adapted) optimal transport problems. In particular, it efficiently computes the adapted Wasserstein distance, combining speed and precision like never before. Check it out and feel free to contribute or give feedback!
