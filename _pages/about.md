Hi, I am Songyan Hou, a PhD student of [Beatrice Acciaio](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~beacciaio/) and [Patrick Cheridito](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~patrickc/) at ETH since September 2021. Before, I completed my master thesis at ETH focusing on machine learning and mathematical finance supervised by [Josef Teichmann](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jteichma/). I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics at Nanjing University.

My current research interests are mainly on Mathematical Finance and Machine Learning. I am interested in exploring models describing the financial world and analyzing these stochastic models. Recently, I am working on applications of optimal transport in mathematical finance and machine learning.
